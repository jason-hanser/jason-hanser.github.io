This page is used to host and highlight projects I've done over the years. All of my code is made public and contained within my GitHub repo. And, whenever possible, I make all of the data possible. However, work-related projects often use data that is cannot be shared due FERPA regulations.

#### Block Schedule Project

[Github](https://github.com/jason-hanser/block-schedule), [Part I](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jason-hanser/block-schedule/blob/master/block-schedule-walkthrough-p1.html), [Part II](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jason-hanser/block-schedule/blob/master/block-schedule-walkthrough-p2.html)

In response to COVID-19, Eckerd College decided to implement a block schedule for the fall semester of 2020. That is, rather than taking courses simultaneously, students who take one course as a time. However, the decision to implement the block schedule was made after studentâ€™s had registered for the fall semester. Rather than forcing all students to re-register, I write a script --- using a genetic algorithm --- to design a schedule that would minimize the number of course registration conflicts.


#### College Admission Essay Topic Modelling Project

[Github](https://github.com/jason-hanser/college-admission-essays), [Write-up](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jason-hanser/college-admission-essays/blob/master/college-admission-essays.html)

Despite being a significant part of a student's application, the college admission essay receives little attention from an analytics standpoint. Here, I modelled topic themes of college admissions essay using LDA to examine whether an applicant's essay could be used to predict enrollment and/or retention. 


#### Autumn Term Placement Project

[Github](https://github.com/jason-hanser/at-placement-project), [Write-up](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jason-hanser/at-placement-project/blob/master/at-placement-walkthrough.html)

Prior to the normal semester, incoming first year students at Eckerd College take a three week course as part of Autumn Term. These condensed courses are special topic courses taught by faculty from across the college. In the past, students were placed into these section, more or less, at random. I wrote a script --- a modified implementation of the assignment problem --- to place students into Autumn Term sections based on their academic interest and the discipline of Autumn Term faculty. 


### Fantasy Baseball

#### Data & Web Scrapers

[Github](https://github.com/jason-hanser/fantasy-baseball/tree/main/1%20-%20Scraping%20and%20Cleaning), [Dropbox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v3m6s84997jmkwq/AADTI3MCzcNeV8C4Qlu1lW7-a?dl=0)

A bunch of data scraped from ESPN and Baseball Reference as part of a larger, pet project. You can download the raw and clean data using the Dropbox link above, while the github link contains the web scrapers as well a script to clean the raw data.

#### Wine Classification

[Github](https://github.com/jason-hanser/Wine-Reviews), [Write-up](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jason-hanser/Wine-Reviews/blob/master/Wine-Reviews.html)

A simple classification project using a bag-of-words approach to predict a wine's variety based on its description.
